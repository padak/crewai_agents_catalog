# Telegram Gateway Agent Project Guidelines

## Environment Setup
- Always use Python virtual environment (venv) for dependency isolation
- Create venv in the project root with: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate venv before working: 
  - Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
  - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Keep a single requirements.txt file in the project root

## Agent Design Principles
- Separate agents by function (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Gateway agents (like Telegram) should only handle communication
- Specialized agents should perform specific tasks (research, analysis, etc.)
- Use crew orchestration to connect agents rather than embedding functionality

## Code Organization
- Store agent definitions in separate files
- Use YAML for configuration when possible
- Keep API keys in .env files (never commit these to version control)
- Document agent responsibilities clearly

## Development Workflow
- Test individual agents before integrating into crews
- Run with verbose logging during development
- Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages
