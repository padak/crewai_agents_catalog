# CrewAI Upgrade Summary

## Upgrade Process

We have successfully upgraded the Telegram Gateway Agent project to support both the original CrewAI version (0.11.2) and the latest version (0.102.0). Here's a summary of the changes made:

### Environment Setup

1. Created a new virtual environment for the latest CrewAI version:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv venv_crewai_latest
   ```

2. Installed the latest CrewAI and dependencies:
   ```bash
   source venv_crewai_latest/bin/activate
   pip install crewai==0.102.0
   pip install google-search-results serpapi
   pip install langchain langchain-community
   ```

3. Maintained the original environment for backward compatibility:
   ```bash
   # Original environment with Python 3.13.1
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

### API Changes

The upgrade required several API changes due to differences between CrewAI 0.11.2 and 0.102.0:

1. **Task Definition**:
   - Added required `expected_output` field to Task objects
   - Example: `Task(description="...", expected_output="...", agent=...)`

2. **Crew Parameters**:
   - Changed `verbose` parameter from numeric (2) to boolean (True/False)
   - Added `process` parameter with `Process.sequential` value

3. **Tool Integration**:
   - Replaced built-in `SerpAPITool` with custom tool implementation using LangChain's `BaseTool`
   - Created custom `WebSearchTool` class for web search functionality

### Documentation Updates

1. Updated `README.md` with:
   - Information about both environments
   - Installation instructions for each environment
   - Examples of using web search tools in both versions

2. Created `docs/crewai_version_notes.md` with:
   - Detailed compatibility information
   - API changes between versions
   - Code examples for both versions

3. Created example scripts:
   - `examples/search_example_original.py` for CrewAI 0.11.2
   - `examples/search_example_latest.py` for CrewAI 0.102.0

4. Organized test scripts:
   - Moved test scripts to a dedicated `tests` directory
   - Maintained original functionality in the new location

## Testing

We verified the installation and functionality of CrewAI 0.102.0 by:

1. Creating a test script (`tests/test_crewai_version.py`)
2. Successfully running the test script in the new environment
3. Confirming that Agent, Task, and Crew objects can be created

## Next Steps

To fully migrate the project to the latest CrewAI version:

1. Update the main application code to use the new API structure
2. Test the Telegram Gateway Agent with the latest CrewAI version
3. Consider implementing additional features available in CrewAI 0.102.0

## Conclusion

The project now supports both CrewAI 0.11.2 (with Python 3.13.1) and CrewAI 0.102.0 (with Python 3.11.6), providing flexibility for development and testing. The documentation has been updated to guide users on how to work with either version.
